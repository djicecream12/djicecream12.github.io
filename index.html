    <h2>👋 About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a high school student with a passion for aerospace engineering, physics, and coding. On AstroSimulations, like the name suggests, I run simulations to understand orbital mechanics, AI in space tech, and more. I also created a blog "Space, Simplified", where I explain advanced space science to other teens (and non-teens alike) in simple language. My goal is to innovate in space research and make it accessible to everyone!

    <h2>🚀 Featured Projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>1. Orbit Visualizer 🌍</strong><br/>
        <p>This project simulates satellites orbitting Earth in different orbits (LEO, MEO, GEO) using Python. It visualizes circular (or elliptical) orbits based on basic physics, giving an animated view of orbital motion.</p>

        <strong>2. Rocket Trajectory Simulation 🚀</strong><br/>
        <p>This project simulates a vertically launched rocket's motion considering gravitational force, air drag, and thrust. The program calculates and plots real-time altitude, velocity, and time until the rocket returns to the ground. It displays key performance stats like maximum altitude and total flight duration.</p>

        <strong>3. Solar System Simulation 🌌</strong><br/>
        <p>This project simulates different angular speeds to match the orbits of each planet in real-time. Using arrow keys on the keyboard, you can increase or decrease the time (which adjusts the speeds of the planets).</p>

        <strong>4. Space Debris Cleanup Simulation🛰️</strong><br/>
        <p>This project simulates three autonomous satellites for each orbit (LEO, MEO, GEO) that tracks and removes space debris. The satellite will trail the debris and clear it, modelling detection range, classification, and pursuit behavior.</p>
